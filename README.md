# Skill Exchange Platform- Project 13

Skill Exchange Platform is a web application designed to facilitate the exchange of skills among users. Participants can register to teach and learn different skills, creating a collaborative learning community. The frontend is built using React and leverages modern technologies to provide a smooth and optimized user experience.

# Features

#Registration and Authentication

Registration form for new users.
Login system to access the platform's advanced features.

## Skill Requests List

View skill requests (available after logging in).
Add skill requests to a favorites list for easy tracking.

## User Profile

View and edit personal data.
Publish new skill requests.
Manage skills the user wants to learn or teach.

## Messaging

Users can contact others through private messages linked to skill requests.
The system is not a real-time chat;
The recipient of the message can reply only once, either to accept or reject the exchange.
After the recipientâ€™s reply, the initial sender can send one final message to conclude the conversation.
If the sender includes their contact information in the message, users can connect outside the platform if they wish.

## Advanced Filters

Home Page: Search by desired skill to direct users to a filtered list (Skill Pool).
Skill Pool: Additional filters for teaching skills, learning skills, and geographic location.
